# Country Calling Codes application

## How to run

## Initial Task

### Functional requirements

Write a microservice to determine the country by phone number.

The user enters the phone number, the system validates it and shows the country or error message.

For country codes, use the table on the page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes

(You must download data from it every time you start the service.)

### Non-functional requirements

### Backend

* Java 8+
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA â€“ MySQL
* Maven/Gradle
* HTTP, RESTful service with JSON data format.

### Frontend

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

### Comments

* The application must be assembled and launched from the command line, on port 8080.
* It should also be possible to run tests and view reports on them.
* All calls to the application are made through the RESTful service with JSON as the data format.
* The appearance of the interface is unimportant, enough neat HTML.
* For queries, use any AJAX-capable framework, you can just JQuery.
* Data validation, tests are mandatory.
